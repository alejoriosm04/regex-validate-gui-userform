    <tt>> Regex Validate GUI Userform</tt>
</h1>

A GUI user form with Tkinter that uses Regex to validate the user inputs. Also, it saves the records in a database to be able to log in and see the user information.

Project for the second-semester course "Programming Languages" (ST0244) taught at EAFIT University by prof Edison Valencia.

## Features

- 🔍 Checks valid syntax of user inputs, according to certain parameters.

- 🧬 Analyzes the expressions with a regex process.

- 🗝 Saves your information in a database, to be accessed for you at any time with your username and password.

## Motivation

The main aim of this project was to use regular expressions in a useful situation and go further with the project, creating something user-friendly with a GUI.

In other words, learn how to use the Python Regex Library (`re`) and one of the Python GUI libraries (`Tkinter`).
